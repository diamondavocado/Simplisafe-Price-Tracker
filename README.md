Manual price monitoring for SimpliSafe.co.uk

SimpliSafe.co.uk sells so-called "smart" home security equipment.

It seems to constantly advertise some kind of special offer or "private sale" (ironically named since it's available to everyone).

I don't trust slick marketing so I decided to keep track of SimpliSafe's prices.

Prices are as listed on their website and include any discounts offered.

By the way, the system **does not** send alerts to your phone unless you're subscribed to the *Pro Premium* plan at £19.99 per month which is utterly ridiculous. Not so smart now, is it?
