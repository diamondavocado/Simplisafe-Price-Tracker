Manual price monitoring for SimpliSafe.co.uk

SimpliSafe.co.uk sells so-called "smart" home security equipment.

It seems to constantly advertise some kind of special offer or "private sale" (ironically named since it's available to everyone).

I don't trust slick marketing so I decided to keep track of SimpliSafe's prices.

Prices are as listed on their website and include any discounts offered.

# Notes

* Simplisafe's system **does NOT send alerts to your phone** unless you're subscribed to the *Pro Premium* plan at Â£19.99 per month. 
* An internet connection is required to set up the system, even if you don't plan on using it as a "smart" system.
* If you are not subscribed to any of their plans, and only use the system as a traditional "dumb" alarm, the system will still collect data and usage metrics which will be sent to Simplisafe.

Not so smart now, is it?
